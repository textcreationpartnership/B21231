            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>O Sir, if that be the <hi>Towzer</hi> you mean, 'tis he that broke his Halter in Effigie, and whom the Devil lash'd out of the Parliaments way, whilst the cunning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites look'd on, with Trouble to see their poor Bandog forc'd to hide his Head. But if I did know where he was, I should not tell you; it may be he is gone to <hi>Scotland</hi> for his friend H.B. had a Letter from Him the other day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, he is, I believe nearer home, and begins again to groule, and foist secret and seditious Pamplets, as he was wont, <hi>incognito,</hi> since the Dissolution of the Parliament. But since he is no Papist, nor Jesuite, as you most learnedly have made <hi>Pragmaticus</hi> believe, why don't he appear as he was wont?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>He wont appear for reasons best known to himself. It is not for fear of such Fellows as you. But I hope yet to see <hi>Towzer</hi> Tryumphant: the day is coming, that he will appear in splendor, with a Whip at his Tayl, and a Bell about his Neck, and then you shall see your poor sneaking Currs will run away with their Tayls between their Legs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! Oh! that is when <hi>Mack</hi> enters with the Popes Procession. When his Holiness his great Toe shall be enshrined in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> sung at the first saying of Mass in St. <hi>Peters.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>For all I have so rationally convinc'd <hi>Pragmaticus,</hi> that he is no Papist nor Jesuite, I see you still believe him one.</p>

               <p>Do you think then that <hi>Towzer</hi> is of no Religion? what dare you believe that he is no Protestant? and not a better Protestant than the Peer that made the Speech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Shall I tell you what I think? for since you say, I dare not think him a Papist, neither Barefac'd, nor in Masquerade, then I will think him a Luke-warm Protestant.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>A Luke-warm Protestant: what is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Why it is such an one as at this time ought to be Spew'd out, 'tis such an one that would conjoyn the Mass and the Common Prayer, it is such an one that would Entail the Crown to a Popish Successor, such an one, that under the name of a Protestant would fain Crush to pieces all Dissenters: Such an one who would fain see Arbitrary Government florish in <hi>England,</hi> and that almost hates the name of a Parliament: That endeavours to promote a Faction, and to set up the Image of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar,</hi> and to make all men to fall down and worship it; one that ralls at Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning and scoffs at all appearance of Goodness and Sobriety.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, hold, you'l be out of Breath anon. Can <hi>Towzer</hi> be all this and no Papist?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, he is a reeling Protestant, only reeling towards Popery, but when the Altar is set up he'l fall flat before it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>Towzer</hi> says, he is a true sincere Protestant, one of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a reformed Papist, and ought not I to believe him? Sure he best knows his own Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi Ang.</speaker>
               <p>You may believe him if you please, but so long as he Barks <hi>Romish,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, with many others, that he Eats of the Popes Bread, and if he be not of the Popes Religion, he is so much the worse to defile his own Protestant Nest; and to tear it almost to pieces with his Scratching Claws. A Tree is known by its Fruit, and we judge only of <hi>Towzer</hi> by his Barking, which is almost plain down Romish. Has he not whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all the World besides: and has he not fawn'd and gloz'd on the very Plotters themselves, and their Adherents? has he not generally given occasion of Offence? I say, if he be not a Papist, he is then a very unlucky <hi>Towzer,</hi> that has set the whole Troop of the little Currs of the Parish a Barking at him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Poor <hi>Towzer!</hi> I see there is no pitty among you: methinks you should not run a Dog down, that is under Affliction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Affliction, he says, is the way to promotion: no doubt but he has gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Masters, that can and will pay him well for his Sufferings. We find he is the same <hi>Towzer</hi> still, and the Nation is so well acquainted with his Barking that they know his Voyce, tho they cannot see the Ban-dog.</p>

But let us hear you. As for his being a Jesuite you may spare your pains. Though a Married Priest and Jesuite may be Dispensed with, witness <hi>L. C. M.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, I say <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Papist because he says so himself, and you ought to believe him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Belief is an Art I am not Master of, unless convinced by Reason or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, both which has made me believe other ways, and many Thousands beside.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>

                  </gap> you. But stay, I say then <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Papist, because his own Conscience tells him so; what say you to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>There is something in that indeed. But he has described so many strange sort of Consciences, that I believe he knows not his own, and besides I have but his word for it; and he may have a lying Conscience for ought I know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, If you won't believe Conscience, I know not what to say to you; for that ought to be believed before Oaths or Proofs, be they never so plain. But I have another Knock down Argument for you, and that must make you of my Mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>What's that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Towzer</hi> has often Bark'd against the Papists, and is a pretended Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrer of them, as well as of the Fanaticks, therefore he can't be a Papist.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Ha! ha! he! You have knockt me down indeed. There's many a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite has done the same; They can rail at their Friends, praise their Enemies, hug those they intend to stab, drink with you and cut your Throat, as well as being Priests, wear Perrukes, Swords, and swear <hi>God Damn me,</hi> â€” O! there's more than all this done for the Cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>But one Argument more and the Devil go with you, if you are not convinc'd. <hi>Towzer</hi> has been always Loyal to his King, and therefore no Papist.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Towzer</hi> says so, but there is a question if one can be at once faithful to the D. and Loyal to the K? But have a care what you say, the Papists will take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly to hear you say a Papist can't be Loyal. I hope the D. is very Loyal, as well as <hi>Towzer,</hi> and yet he is a Papist, what say you now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Well to satisfie you and all the World, if you please, <hi>Towzer</hi> shall swear he is no Papist, and take any Oath or Test you shall give him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>That won't do: none of those Bones will choak a Papist; alas they can swallow them as easily as a J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gler a Knife or a Cup. They have cunning evading Tricks an Oath Legerdemain you are not acquainted with; nay, they can Die with these Oaths in their mouths, and go to Heaven immediately.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>I see you are an hard foul-mouth'd Beast, such an one as <hi>Towzer</hi> inveighs against, that will believe nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Give me but one Argument, in which I can find but any thing of sence or reason, and he believe you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Why Logically thus: <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Christian, but every Papist is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; <hi>ergo, Towzer</hi> is no Papist.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>By the <hi>French</hi> Kings Garlick eaters, this smells strong of Reason, and here's my hand on't; I'le never call <hi>Towzer</hi> a Papist Dog any more, but plain unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Towzer.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad I have converted you, I never Dialogued any body in my life, but I convinc'd them at last: poor <hi>Pragmaticus</hi> went away the other day as well satisfied as could be, and no doubt but with my Arguments he will convince the whole Nation, at least the better and more learned sort, that poor <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Papist.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>But to satisfie my Conscience, and the more to confirm me in this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Papist, but a plain Pagan <hi>Towzer,</hi> let me ask you some few Questions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Ask what you please, I shall endeavour to satisfie you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Angl.</speaker>
               <p>Why does <hi>Towzer</hi> still endeavour to turn all the Papists Plots into <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule?</hi> and why did you (for you are his Scholar and speak his words) after your drolling with <hi>Pragmaticus,</hi> say, perhaps, some of those bloody things might be true? <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps</hi> â€” t'was an ugly word, and look'd like a Papist.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Why, wont you give a Fidler leave to use his Fidle-stick? <hi>Touzer</hi> is so us'd to droll and jest in all he says, that he can't forbear: 'tis only his Humour; but, he made amends, and granted <hi>Pragmaticus,</hi> the Papists might be all what he charg'd them with, and the Authors also of the last great Plague in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil. Angl.</speaker>
               <p>There was a Jest: but, Let me tell you, Tho they were not Authors of the Plague, they have been of a worse to the whole Kingdom since that, by their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conspiracy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph. Le.</speaker>
               <p>I grant you that, but still <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Papist, tho he laughs at all those Plots after his way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph. Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if it be only his humour: 'tis well enough. But how shall I know that Papists are Christians?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Because we were Reformed from them, and because they are full of Boyls, Sores, and blaines of Errors and Abuses; and are not <hi>Towzers</hi> nor Cats, nor Wolves, Dragons, nor fiery Serpents.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil. Angl.</speaker>
               <p>Very good, They are not those Creatures in <hi>specie,</hi> but all those, and far worse <hi>allegorically,</hi> as many poor Christians in most Countries can testify, and thousands of harmless <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> They are <hi>Christians,</hi> I grant you, <hi>in nomine,</hi> but, in <hi>practice</hi> as far from the Apostles, as the Pope is from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the distance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from Earth. Therefore, if <hi>Towzer</hi> be not a Papist <hi>in nomine,</hi> by name, is he not one by Nature, or <hi>Allegorically?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi. Le.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, nay, if you run to Allegories, i'le leave you: I have nothing to say to Allegories. I say, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Christian, 'tis no matter how: and I have prov'd it. And, that <hi>Towzer</hi> is no Papist-Christian, but <hi>Touzer,</hi> grinning, snarling, snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, railing, and dialoguing <hi>Towzer,</hi> with a whip and a bell, with which he will lash shortly this brazen fac'd Age, this impudent Age in which we live.</p>
